Building C# Example
===================
Before compiling or running the example, make sure the environment variable 
NDDSHOME is set to the directory where your version of RTI Connext is installed.

Run rtiddsgen with the -example option and the target architecture of your 
choice (e.g., i86Win32dotnet4.0). The RTI Connext Core 
Libraries and Utilities Getting Started Guide describes this process in detail. 
Follow the same procedure to generate the code and build the examples. Do not 
use the -replace option.

On Windows systems (assuming you want to generate an example for 
i86Win32dotnet4.0) run:

rtiddsgen -language C# -example i86Win32dotnet4.0 -ppDisable market_data.idl

Note: If you are using Visual Studio Express add the -express option to the 
command, i.e.,

rtiddsgen -language C# -example i86Win32dotnet4.0 -express -ppDisable market_data.idl

...you will see messages that look like this:

File C:\local\MultiChannel\cs\market_data_subscriber.cs already exists and will 
 not be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file with
 the new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.
File C:\local\MultiChannel\cs\market_data_publisher.cs already exists and will
 not be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file with
 the new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.
File C:\local\MultiChannel\cs\USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml already exists and will not
 be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file with the
 new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.

This is normal and is only informing you that the subscriber/publisher code has 
not been replaced, which is fine since all the source files for the example are 
already provided.

Rtiddsgen generates two solutions for Visual Studio C++ and C#, that you will 
use to build the types and the C# example, respectively. First open  
market_data_type-dotnet4.0.sln and build the solution. Once you've done that,
open market_data_example-csharp.sln and build the C# example.

Running C# Example
==================
In two separate command prompt windows for the publisher and subscriber. Run
the following commands from the example directory (this is necessary to ensure
the application loads the QoS defined in USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml):

On Windows systems run:

bin\<build_type>-VS2010\async_publisher.exe  <domain_id> 400
bin\<build_type>-VS2010\async_subscriber.exe <domain_id> 10
  

The applications accept two arguments:

   1. The <domain #>. Both applications must use the same domain # in order to
   communicate. The default is 0.
   2. How long the examples should run, measured in samples for the publisher 
   and sleep periods for the subscriber. A value of '0' instructs the 
   application to run forever; this is the default.

While generating the output below, we used values that would capture the most 
interesting behavior.

Wireshark Output
================
<See multichannel.pcap. Observe that data samples are being sent on the wire in
 only the channels that are necessary for delivering samples that pass the
 reader's filter.>
<In contrast, singlechannel.pcap shows the wire traffic when multichannel is not
 used and when the reader specifies a multicast.receive_address of 239.255.0.1.
 Observe that all data samples are being sent on the wire, i.e. reader-side
 filtering, since there is only one channel.>
