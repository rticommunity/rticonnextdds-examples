# Prototyper

RTI Prototyper is a tool to accelerate RTI Connext DDS application development
and scenario testing. It provides RTI Connext DDS application developers with a
quick and easy-to-use mechanism to try out realistic scenarios on their own
computer systems and networks, and get immediate information on the expected
performance, resource usage, and behavior of their system.

In this directory you will find examples illustrating some of the most
important features of RTI Prototyper. For more information, please refer to the
[RTI Prototyper Getting Started
Guide](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds/prototyper/RTI_ConnextDDS_CoreLibraries_Prototyper_GettingStarted.pdf).
