# Example Code: Asynchronous Publication

:warning: **Note**: This example uses the **Legacy .NET API**. Until it is
updated, you can learn more about the **new Connext DDS C# API** in the
[Getting Started Guide](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.1.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds_professional/getting_started_guide/index.html).

## Building C# Example

Before compiling or running the example, make sure the environment variable
`NDDSHOME` is set to the directory where your version of *RTI Connext* is
installed.

Run *rtiddsgen* with the `-example` option and the target architecture of your
choice (e.g., *i86Win32VS2010*). The *RTI Connext Core Libraries and Utilities
Getting Started Guide* describes this process in detail. Follow the same
procedure to generate the code and build the examples. **Do not use the
`-replace` option.** Assuming you want to generate an example for
*i86Win32VS2010* run:

```sh
rtiddsgen -language C# -example i86Win32VS2010 -ppDisable async.idl
```

**Note**: If you are using *Visual Studio Express* add the `-express` option to
the command, i.e.:

```sh
rtiddsgen -language C# -example i86Win32VS2010 -express -ppDisable async.idl
```

You will see messages that look like this:

```plaintext
File C:\local\asynchronous_publication\cs\async_subscriber.cs already exists and
will not be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file
with the new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.
File C:\local\asynchronous_publication\cs\async_publisher.cs already exists and
will not be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file
with the new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.
```

This is normal and is only informing you that the subscriber/publisher code has
not been replaced, which is fine since all the source files for the example are
already provided.

*rtiddsgen* generates two solutions for *Visual Studio C++* and *C#*, that you
will use to build the types and the C# example, respectively. First open
*async_type-dotnet4.0.sln* and build the solution. Once you've done that, open
*async_example-csharp.sln* and build the C# example.

## Running C# Example

In two separate command prompt windows for the publisher and subscriber. Run the
following commands from the example directory (this is necessary to ensure the
application loads the QoS defined in *USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml*):

On Windows systems run:

```sh
bin\<build_type>-VS2010\async_publisher.exe  <domain_id> <samples_to_send>
bin\<build_type>-VS2010\async_subscriber.exe <domain_id> <sleep_periods>
```

The applications accept up to two arguments:

1.  The `<domain_id>`. Both applications must use the same domain ID in order to
    communicate. The default is 0.

2.  How long the examples should run, measured in samples for the publisher and
    sleep periods for the subscriber. A value of '0' instructs the application
    to run forever; this is the default.
