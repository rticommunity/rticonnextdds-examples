```sh
javac -classpath .;%NDDSHOME%\lib\java\nddsjava.jar UnionExample.java
```

- On *UNIX* systems (including *Linux* and *MacOS X*) run:

```sh
javac -classpath .:$NDDSHOME/lib/java/nddsjava.jar UnionExample.java
```

## Running Java Example

- On *Windows* Systems:

```sh
java -cp .;%NDDSHOME%\lib\java\nddsjava.jar UnionExample
```

- On *UNIX* systems:

```sh
java -cp .:$NDDSHOME/lib/java/nddsjava.jar UnionExample
