# Connext DDS

RTI Connext DDS is a software connectivity framework for real-time distributed
applications. It provides the middleware communications service that
programmers need to distribute time-critical data between embedded and/or
enterprise devices or nodes. Connext DDS uses a publish-subscribe
communications model to make data-distribution efficient and robust. Connext
DDS also supports the Request-Reply communication pattern.

In this directory you will find examples that illustrate some of the most
important features of the RTI Connext DDS core libraries. For more information
