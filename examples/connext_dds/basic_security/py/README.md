# Example Code: Basic Security

## Running this Example

### Initial Setup

In order to run this example you require some security artifacts (certificates,
signed Governance and Permissions Document). The easiest way to acquire them is
to copy them from the rti_workspace examples. They can be found in
`<rti_workspace>/<version>/examples/dds_security`. If this folder is copied in
whole to `examples/connext_dds/basic_security` the example will work with no
modifications to the SecureQos.xml file. Otherwise, the strings in
SecureQos.xml must be updated to reflect the locations of these artifacts.

### Linux and macOS systems

Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for macOS) must include
`$NDDSHOME/lib/<architecture>`.
You must also include the path to your crypto libraries. They are in
`$NDDSHOME/third_party/openssl-<version>/<architecture>/<release or debug>/lib`
(location of libcrypto.so and libssl.so).
If you are using the Security Plugins for wolfSSL, your LD_LIBRARY_PATH must
include
`$NDDSHOME/third_party/wolfssl-<version>/<architecture>/<release or debug>/lib`
(location of libwolfssl.so).

If using Certicom Security Builder Engine for QNX, your LD_LIBRARY_PATH must
include
`$NDDSHOME/third_party/openssl-<version>/<architecture>/release/lib/:$CERTICOM_SBENGINEHOME/tools/sb/sb-$CERTICOMOS/lib/:$CERTICOM_SBENGINEHOME/lib/$CERTICOMOS.`

To run this example, type the following commands in two different command
shells (one command in each shell), either on the same machine or on different
machines:

  > python3 secure_publisher.py
  > python3 secure_subscriber.py

### Windows systems

Your PATH must include
`%NDDSHOME%\lib\<architecture>` and
`%NDDSHOME%\third_party\openssl-<version>\<architecture>\<release or debug>\bin`
(location of the libcrypto and libssl DLLs).

To run this example, type the following commands in two different command
shells (one command in each shell), either on the same machine or on different
machines:

  > python3 secure_publisher.py
  > python3 secure_subscriber.py

### Accepted parameters

The following parameters are accepted:

- `-d` for the domain id
- `-c` for the number of samples to send
- `-p` for the profile (A, B, RSA_A, RSA_B, ECDSA_P384_A, or ECDSA_P384_B)

To run this example
using the "rsa"(**) algorithm suite, add a `-p` command-line argument: "rsa".
Pass "p384" (***) for the `-p` command-line argument if you want to use the
"ecdsa secp384r1" algorithm suite.

-   The "ecdsa" algorithm suite consists of ECDSA+P256+SHA256 (digital signature
for identity trust chain and authentication) and ECDHE-CEUM+P256
(key establishment).
-   The "rsa" algorithm suite consists of RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5+2048+SHA256 (digital
signature for identity trust chain), RSASSA-PSS-MGF1SHA256+2048+SHA256
(digital signature for authentication) and ECDHE-CEUM+P256 (key establishment).
-   The "ecdsa secp384r1" algorithm suite consists of ECDSA+P384+SHA384 (digital
signature for identity trust chain and authentication), and ECDHE-CEUM+P384
(key establishment).
