Description
XML QoS Profile for the XML Application - Environment Example

The XML Application definition of the DDS entities in this example is 
loaded from this file.

This file intentionally does not have the default file of USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml.
The application code uses the QosProvider to load the file explicitly instead
loading the default file implicitly.

For more information about XML-Based Application Creation, see the 
RTI Connext DDS Core Libraries XML-Based Application Creation Getting Started Guide.
