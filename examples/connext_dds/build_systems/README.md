# Build system example

This folder contains examples about how to build ConnextDDS applications using
different build systems.

Each example is self documented and shows you how you can integrate the RTI
libraries in your workflow, using the best tools for that.

The C and C++ examples of this repository are built using
[CMake](https://cmake.org/) a build system generator.
