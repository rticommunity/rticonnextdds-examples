# Example Code: Builtin Topics

:warning: **Note**: This example uses the **Legacy .NET API**. Until it is
updated, you can learn more about the **new Connext DDS C# API** in the
[Getting Started Guide](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.1.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds_professional/getting_started_guide/index.html).

## Building C# Example

Before compiling or running the example, make sure the environment variable
NDDSHOME is set to the directory where your version of RTI Connext is installed.

Run rtiddsgen with the -example option and the target architecture of your
choice (e.g., i86Win32VS2010). The RTI Connext Core Libraries and Utilities
Getting Started Guide describes this process in detail. Follow the same
procedure to generate the code and build the examples. Do not use the -replace
option.

On Windows systems (assuming you want to generate an example for i86Win32VS2010)
run:

```sh
rtiddsgen -language C# -example i86Win32VS2010 -ppDisable msg.idl
```

Note: If you are using Visual Studio Express add the -express option to the
command, i.e.,

```sh
rtiddsgen -language C# -example i86Win32VS2010 -express -ppDisable msg.idl
```

...you will see messages that look like this:

```plaintext
File C:\local\Builtin_Topics\cs\msg_subscriber.cs already exists and will not be
replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file with the new
content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.
File C:\local\Builtin_Topics\cs\msg_publisher.cs already exists and will not be
replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file with the new
content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.
```

This is normal and is only informing you that the subscriber/publisher code has
not been replaced, which is fine since all the source files for the example are
already provided.

Rtiddsgen generates two solutions for Visual Studio C++ and C#, that you will
use to build the types and the C# example, respectively. First open
msg_type-dotnet4.0.sln and build the solution. Once you've done that, open
msg_example-csharp.sln and build the C# example.

## Running C# Example

In two separate command prompt windows for the publisher and subscriber. Run the
following commands from the example directory (this is necessary to ensure the
application loads the QoS defined in USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml):

On Windows systems run:

```sh
bin\<build_type>-VS2010\msg_publisher.exe  <domain_id> <samples_to_send>
bin\<build_type>-VS2010\msg_subscriber.exe <domain_id> <sleep_periods> <participant_auth> <reader_auth>
```

The applications accept up to two arguments (four to subscriber):

1.  The `<domain_id>`. Both applications must use the same domain id in order to
    communicate. The default is 0.

2.  How long the examples should run, measured in samples for the publisher and
    sleep periods for the subscriber. A value of '0' instructs the application
    to run forever; this is the default.

3.  (subscriber only) The participant authorization string. This is checked
    against the authorization that the publisher is expecting. The default is
    "password".

4.  (subscriber only) The reader authorization string. If and only if the
    reader's participant didn't get authorized, then this value is checked
    against the authorization that the publisher is expecting. The default is
    "Reader_Auth".

While generating the output below, we used values that would capture the most
interesting behavior.
