# Example Code: Python Distributed Logger Application

See the example description in the top-level [README](../../README.md) file.

## Running the Example

### Example Application

Run the application in a terminal as follows:

```sh
python dist_logger_example.py [options]
```

Run with ``--help`` to see the available options.

You should see the messages that are being logged on each iteration printed
on the terminal.

### Visualizing the log messages

Once the example application is running, open RTI Spy or
RTI Admin Console as described in the top-level [README](../../README.md) file.

You should be able to visualize the logging messages being sent
by the application.
