# Example Code: FlatData and ZeroCopy examples

## Explore the Example

### CameraImage.idl

`CameraImage.idl` defines four different versions of `CameraImage`, with
different annotations for each mode.

### CameraImage_publisher.cxx and CameraImage_subscriber.cxx

`CameraImage_publisher.cxx` and `CameraImage_subscriber.cxx` implement each mode
in a separate function:

-   `CameraImage_publisher.cxx`:

    - `publisher_flat()`
    - `publisher_zero_copy()`
    - `publisher_flat_zero_copy()`
    - `publisher_plain()`

-   `CameraImage_subscriber.cxx`:

    - `subscriber_flat()`
    - `subscriber_zero_copy()`
    - `subscriber_flat_zero_copy()`
    - `subscriber_plain()`

These functions are very similar but have a few differences specific to each
feature:

-   **Language binding**: `*_flat` and `*_flat_zero_copy` use the FlatData
    language binding, with a distinct way to create and access the data sample.
    `*_zero_copy` and `*_plain` use the regular (`PLAIN`) language binding.

-   **Sample lifecycle**: `*_flat`, `*_zero_copy` and `*_flat_zero_copy` use
    DataWriter-managed samples, obtained with the `get_loan` function. The
    application doesn't delete these samples.

### Common.hpp

`Common.hpp` implements functionality used by both applications:

- Waiting for discovery
- Functions to populate and print the data
- Application options

### QoS Settings

The FlatData profile used in this example inherits from the builtin
`StrictReliable.LargeData` profile. This builtin profile sets up the middleware
for sending large data by enabling some optimizations in the reliability
protocol, the history, and the handling of dynamic memory allocations. In the
FlatData profile, the *Durability QoS* of the DataWriter is set to volatile to
enable managed samples to be reused when they are acknowledged. The
*DataRepresentation QoS* is set to *Extended CDR version 2* on both the
DataWriter and the DataReader since FlatData language binding is only supported
with this data representation. The transport settings of the participant are
also tuned to ensure reduced latency while sending large data.

## Building the Example :wrench:

To build this example, first run CMake to generate the corresponding build
files. We recommend you use a separate directory to store all the generated
files (e.g., ./build).

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Once you have run CMake, you will find a number of new files in your build
directory (the list of generated files will depend on the specific CMake
Generator). To build the example, run CMake as follows:

```sh
cmake --build .
```

**Note**: if you are using a multi-configuration generator, such as Visual
Studio solutions, you can specify the configuration mode to build as follows:

```sh
cmake --build . --config Release|Debug
```

Alternatively, you can use directly the generated infrastructure (e.g.,
Makefiles or Visual Studio Solutions) to build the example. If you generated
Makefiles in the configuration process, run make to build the example. Likewise,
if you generated a Visual Studio solution, open the solution and follow the
regular build process.

## Running the Example

In two separate command prompt windows for the publisher and subscriber. Run the
following commands from the example directory (this is necessary to ensure the
application loads the QoS defined in *USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml*):

On *Windows* systems run:

```sh
CameraImage_publisher.exe -d <domain_id> -m <mode> -s <sample_count> -e <exec_time> -n <ip_addres>
CameraImage_subscriber.exe -d <domain_id> -m <mode> -n <ip_address> --display_samples
```

On *UNIX* systems run:

```sh
./CameraImage_publisher -d <domain_id> -m <mode> -s <sample_count> -e <exec_time> -n <ip_addres>
./CameraImage_subscriber -d <domain_id> -m <mode> -n <ip_address> --display_samples
```

The application has the following arguments:

1.  The `<domain_id>`. Both applications must use the same domain ID in order to
    communicate. The default is 0.

2.  Publisher subscriber/mode.
    1.  publisher_flat
    2.  publisher_zero_copy
    3.  publisher_flat_zero_copy
    4.  publisher_plain

3.  (Publisher only) How long the examples should run, measured in samples
(-s option). The default is infinite.

4.  (Publisher only) The `<exec_time>` in seconds.

5.  (Subscriber only) If the `--display_samples` option is given, the
subscriber will print the sample data.

6.  When a device has multiple interfaces, it is recommended to use `-n` when
running on separate nodes. This ensures that data is sent over one network
interface only.

## Publisher Output

*CameraImage_publisher* waits for the subscriber and then prints the average
one-way latency every 4 seconds:

```plaintext
Running publisher_zero_copy
Waiting for the subscriber application
Discovery complete
Average end-to-end latency: 81 microseconds
Average end-to-end latency: 81 microseconds
Average end-to-end latency: 81 microseconds
Average end-to-end latency: 82 microseconds
```

## Subscriber Output

*CameraImage_subscriber* waits for the publisher and responds to each ping with
a pong message:

```plaintext
Running subscriber_zero_copy
Waiting for the publisher application
Discovery complete
```

## Customizing the Build

### Configuring Build Type and Generator

By default, CMake will generate build files using the most common generator for
your host platform (e.g., Makefiles on Unix-like systems and Visual Studio
Solutions on Windows). You can use the following CMake variables to modify the
default behavior:

-   `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` - specifies the build mode. Valid values are `Release`
    and `Debug`. See the [CMake documentation for more details
    (Optional)](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html).

-   `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS` - specifies the link mode. Valid values are `ON` for
    dynamic linking and `OFF` for static linking. See [CMake documentation for
    more details
    (Optional)](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html).

-   `-G` - CMake generator. The generator is the native build system used to
    build the source code. All the valid values are described in the CMake
    documentation for [CMake
    Generators](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).

For example, to build an example in Debug/Dynamic mode run CMake as follows:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .. -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64
```

### Configuring Connext Installation Path and Architecture

The CMake build infrastructure will try to guess the location of your Connext
installation and the Connext architecture based on the default settings
for your host platform. If you installed Connext in a custom location, you
can use the `CONNEXTDDS_DIR` variable to indicate the path to your RTI Connext
installation folder. For example:

```sh
cmake -DCONNEXTDDS_DIR=/home/rti/rti_connext_dds-x.y.z ..
```

Also, if you installed libraries for multiple target architectures on your system
(i.e., you installed more than one target `.rtipkg` file), you can use the
`CONNEXTDDS_ARCH` variable to indicate the architecture of the specific libraries
you want to link against. For example:

```sh
cmake -DCONNEXTDDS_ARCH=x64Linux3gcc5.4.0 ..
```

### CMake Build Infrastructure

The `CMakeListst.txt` script that builds this example uses a generic CMake
function called `connextdds_add_example` that defines all the necessary constructs
to:

1.  Run RTI Code Generator to generate the serialization/deserialization code
    for the types defined in the IDL file associated with the example.

2.  Build the corresponding Publisher and Subscriber applications.

3.  Copy the `USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml` file into the directory where the publisher
    and subscriber executables are generated.

You will find the definition of `connextdds_add_example`, along with detailed
documentation, in
[resources/cmake/rticonnextdds-cmake-utils/cmake/Modules/ConnextDdsAddExample.cmake
](https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-cmake-utils/blob/main/cmake/Modules/ConnextDdsAddExample.cmake).

For a more comprehensive example on how to build an RTI Connext application
using CMake, please refer to the
[hello_world](../../../connext_dds/build_systems/cmake/) example, which includes
a comprehensive `CMakeLists.txt` script with all the steps and instructions
described in detail.
