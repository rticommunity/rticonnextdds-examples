# Example Code: Built-in QoS Profiles

## Concept

*RTI Connext DDS* provides *Quality of Service* (QoS) that controls the behavior
of the different DDS entities, and allows you to configure the *middleware* to
enable features such as monitoring. To make this process easier, RTI includes a
set of built-in QoS profiles that provide useful *functionality, such as
enabling monitoring or configuring *DataWriters* and *DataReaders* to be
strictly reliable.

The full list of built-in profiles is here:

-   In library `BuiltinQosLib`:

    - Baseline
    - Baseline.5.0.0
    - Baseline.5.1.0
    - Baseline 5.2.0
    - Generic.Common
    - Generic.Monitoring.Common
    - Generic.ConnextMicroCompatibility
    - Generic.OtherDDSVendorCompatibility
    - Generic.510TransportCompatibility

-   In library for experimental profiles (`BuiltinQosLibExp`):

    - Generic.StrictReliable
    - Generic.KeepLastReliable
    - Generic.BestEffort
    - Generic.StrictReliable.HighThroughput
    - Generic.StrictReliable.LowLatency
    - Generic.Participant.LargeData
    - Generic.Participant.LargeData.Monitoring
    - Generic.StrictReliable.LargeData
    - Generic.KeepLastReliable.LargeData
    - Generic.StrictReliable.LargeData.FastFlow
    - Generic.StrictReliable.LargeData.MediumFlow
    - Generic.StrictReliable.LargeData.SlowFlow
    - Generic.KeepLastReliable.LargeData.FastFlow
    - Generic.KeepLastReliable.LargeData.MediumFlow
    - Generic.KeepLastReliable.LargeData.SlowFlow
    - Generic.KeepLastReliable.TransientLocal
    - Generic.KeepLastReliable.Transient
    - Generic.KeepLastReliable.Persistent
    - Generic.AutoTuning
    - Pattern.PeriodicData
    - Pattern.Streaming
    - Pattern.ReliableStreaming
    - Pattern.Event
    - Pattern.AlarmEvent
    - Pattern.Status
    - Pattern.AlarmStatus
    - Pattern.LastValueCache

## Example Description

This example shows how to use built-in profiles in both the XML QoS file and in
the source code. In the XML, the default QoS profiles described in the file
inherit from two different built-in profiles.

1.  The overall default profile inherits from the
    `BuiltinQoSLibExp::Pattern.ReliableStreaming` profile:

    ```xml
    <qos_profile name="profiles_Profile" base_name="BuiltinQosLibExp::Pattern.ReliableStreaming" is_default_qos="true">
    ```

2.  The *DomainParticipant's* QoS overrides this so that the *DomainParticipant*
    can inherit directly from a profile that enables monitoring. This allows the
    *DomainParticipant* to take its specific behavior from a different profile
    than the *DataWriter* and *DataReader*, since the *DomainParticipant's* QoS
    is independent of the reader, and writer-specific streaming reliability QoS:

    ```xml
    <participant_qos base_name="BuiltinQosLib::Generic.Monitoring.Common">
    ```

In this example, the *DomainParticipant* is configured to enable monitoring out
of the box.

**Note that this will require that you link against RTI's dynamic libraries** so
the monitoring library can be loaded correctly. See the README file within each
directory for more details on linking dynamically.

The *DataWriter* and *DataReader* are configured with a QoS profile to enable
streaming reliable data.
