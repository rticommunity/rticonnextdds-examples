# Example Code: Sequences In Dynamic Data

## Building C# Example

The example is contained in the *dynamic_data_sequences.cs* file. Before
compiling or running the example, make sure the environment variable `NDDSHOME`
is set to the directory where you installed *RTI Connext DDS*.

The accompanying *Visual Studio* projects called: *Hello-i86Win32dotnet4.0.sln*
and *Hello-i86Win32VS2010.sln* can be used to compile the application for
*Visual Studio 2010*. Whether the *Connext DDS* version is higher or equal than
5.2.0, you need to use *Hello-i86Win32VS2010.sln*, otherwise use
*Hello-i86Win32dotnet4.0.sln*.

If you are using this method, build the solution in *Visual Studio 2010* and
continue reading *Running C# Example* paragraph.

## Creating a new project

If the architecture or the *Visual Studio* version are different, you need to
create a new *Visual Studio* project. For this task, you can use *rtiddsgen* to
generate it. To use *rtiddsgen* to generate a new project, create a sample idl
file called *Foo.idl*, with the following contents:

```c
struct foo {
    long a;
};
```

and run (assuming you want to generate an example for *i86Win32dotnet4.0*):

```sh
rtiddsgen -language C# -example i86Win32dotnet4.0 -ppDisable Foo.idl
```

Once you have run the application, you will need to modify the generated
solution and add the file *dynamic_data_sequences.cs*. Following the next steps
to get your solution ready to use.

1.  Rename the next files:

    - *Foo-csharp.sln* -> *dynamic_data_sequences.sln*
    - *Foo_publisher-csharp.csproj* -> *dynamic_data_sequences.csproj*

2.  Modify (in text format) *dynamic_data_sequences.sln* and change
    `Foo_publisher-csharp.csproj` to `dynamic_data_sequences.csproj`.

3.  Modify (in text format) *dynamic_data_sequences.csproj* and change these
    lines:

    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="foo_publisher.cs" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

    for:

    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="dynamic_data_sequences.cs" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```

4.  Open this solution with *Visual Studio* and delete manually *Foo_type* and
    *Foo_subscriber-csharp* projects.

5.  You can modify the name of the executable, click with the right button over
    the project and go to properties. In the new panel, modify
    *Application/Assembly* name. This name will be you executable name.

## Running C# Example

Run the following command from the example directory to execute the application.

If you have used the accompanying *Visual Studio* project:

```sh
bin\<build_type>-VS2010\dynamic_data_sequences.exe
```

If you have generated a new *Visual Studio* Project:

```sh
bin\<build_type>-<VSVersion>\Foo_publisher.exe
```
