# RTI Web Integration Service

RTI Web Integration Service, an out-of-the-box solution for integrating
web-based applications and services with RTI Connextâ„¢ DDS.

Traditionally, web-based applications and services have relied on non-standard
interfaces to participate as first-class citizens in the DDS Global Data Space.
Web Integration Service leverages the Web-Enabled DDS OMG standard to provide
a simple generic standards-based interface that provides a transparent bridge
between web-based services and unmodified DDS applications.

Simply set up Web Integration Service to create DDS entities associated with
web-based client applications. No changes are required in the Connext DDS
applications.

In this directory you will find some examples illustrating the most important
features of RTI Web Integration Service, including support for different
languages such as Javascript and Python and different protocols such as HTTP
and WebSockets. For more information, please refer to the [RTI Web Integration
Service User's
Manual](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/manuals/web_integration_service/index.html).
