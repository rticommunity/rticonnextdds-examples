# Example Code: Recording Service Administration

## Concept

*Recording Service* uses the common Remote Administration Platform (see [Remote
Administration
Platform](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.0.0/doc/manuals/recording_service/common/remote_admin_platform.html))
This example shows how to use the platform to send remote commands to a running
instance of Recording Service. Note that this application can also work with a
running instance of *RTI Routing Service*, as the admin platform is common to
both).

## Example Description

This example shows a one-shot application that can be used to send one remote
command to a running application of Recording Service (you can also try to use
it with Routing Service). The application will prepare a command request based
on the command-line parameters provided in the application invocation. After
sending that request out to the service, it will wait for a command reply to be
sent by the service. The application will then exit.

The following files are part of the example:

-   `Requester.hpp` and `Requester.cxx`: these files contain the example C++
    code that prepares and sends the command request and then waits for a reply
    from the running service instance.

-   `USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml`: this file defines DDS XML QoS profiles to be used
    by the application and by *Recording Service*.

-   `recorder_remote_admin.xml`: this is a configuration file for Recording
    Service that enables remote administration, and uses the QoS profiles
    defined in the XML QoS profiles file defined above. By using the same QoS
    profiles in both the application and the *Recording Service* we ensure the
    QoS matching and the reliability of the communication.

## Building the Example

In order to build this example, you need to provide the following variables to
`CMake`:

-   `CONNEXTDDS_DIR`: pointing to the installation of RTI Connext DDS to be
    used.

-   `CONNEXTDDS_ARCH`: the RTI Connext DDS Target architecture to be used in
    your system.

Build the example code by running the following command:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCONNEXTDDS_DIR=<connext dir> -DCONNEXTDDS_ARCH=<connext architecture> ..
cmake --build .
```

> **Note**:
>
> When using a multi-configuration generator, make sure you specify
> the `--config` parameter in your call to `cmake --build .`. In general,
> it's a good practice to always provide it.

This will produce a binary directory (*build*) where the `Requester` application
can be found. The XML files in the source directory are also copied over to this
binary directory so that *Recording Service* can be run directly from this
directory as well.

> **Note:**
>
> In order to build, `CMake` will invoke *RTI DDS Code Generator* on the
> `ServiceCommon.idl`, `ServiceAdmin.idl` and `RecordingServiceTypes.idl` files
> that can be found in `$(CONNEXTDDS_DIR)/resource/idl` directory. These files
> define the communication interface for the remote administration platform and
> any *Recording Service*-specific types (`RecordingServiceTypes.idl`). The
> resulting generated C++ code will be stored in a folder called `generated` in
> the CMake build directory.
>
> **Cross-compilation**:
>
> When you need to cross-compile the example, the above
> command will not work, the assigned compiler won't be the cross-compiler and
> errors may happen when linking against the cross-compiled Connext binaries. To
> fix this, you have to create a file with the architecture name and call CMake
> with a specific flag called `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`. An example of the file to
> create with the toolchain settings (e.g. for an ARM architectures):

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(toolchain_path "<path to>/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian")
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "${toolchain_path}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "${toolchain_path}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++")
```

Then you can call CMake like this:

```sh
cmake -DCONNEXTDDS_DIR=<connext dir> \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<toolchain file created above> \
      -DCONNEXTDDS_ARCH=<connext architecture> ..
```

## Running the Example

First of all, we need a running *Recording Service* instance with remote
administration enabled. We will use the *Recording Service* configuration
shipped with the example, called `recorder_remote_admin.xml`:

```sh
cd <binary directory>
$(CONNEXTDDS_DIR)/bin/rtirecordingservice
        -cfgFile recorder_remote_admin.xml -cfgName remote_admin
```

Note: you can run from other directory, just make sure the
`recorder_remote_admin.xml` and `USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml`

Once the *Recording Service* instance is running, it is ready to receive remote
command requests. The administration app receives the following command-line
parameters:

-   The kind of command to be sent, following a *CRUD* pattern (CREATE, READ,
    UPDATE, DELETE).

-   The identifier of the resource we're accessing, e.g.
    `recording_services/remote_admin/state`

-   [Optional] The arguments that the command kind needs for performing the
    action, e.g. `paused` (if the objective state of the service is *paused*)

-   [Optional] `--domain-id`: this parameter should be used when the *Recording
    Service* instance is running admninistration on a DDS domain different than
    0 (this can be achieved by modifying the XML configuration or using the
    `-remoteAdministrationDomainId` parameter in the invocation). The domain
    specified for this command-line parameter and the one used for remote
    administration of the service should be the same, otherwise the application
    won't be able to connect to the service.

-   [Optional] `--time-tag`: there are commands that are service-specific. This
    command-line parameter allows the user to define a timestamp tag for
    *Recording Service* to store. These tags can later be used to easily,
    symbolically define time ranges to be replayed or converted. This command
    requires a name parameter and optionally, a description (remember to use
    quotes for multi-word descriptions).

To run the administration app, you should go to the binary directory, or if you
run from other directories, make sure the `USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml` file is
present in the directory. We'll now show you some examples on how to send
different commands to the service.

1.  Sending a pause command:

    ```plaintext
    Requester UPDATE /recording_services/remote_admin/state paused
    ```

2.  Sending a timestamp tag command to a service with administration running on
    DDS domain ID 54:

    ```plaintext
    Requester UPDATE /recording_services/remote_admin/storage/sqlite:tag_timestamp --domain-id 54 --time-tag "A timestamp tag" "A timestamp tag description"
    ```

3.  Sending a shutdown command

    ```plaintext
    Requester DELETE /recording_services/remote_admin
    ```

## Requirements

To run this example you will need:

- RTI Connext Professional version 6.0.0 or higher.
- CMake version 3.11 or higher
