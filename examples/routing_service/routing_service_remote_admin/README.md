# Example Code: Routing Service Administration

## Concept

*Routing Service* uses the common Remote Administration Platform (see [Remote
Administration
Platform](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/6.1.0/doc/manuals/connext_dds_professional/services/routing_service/common/remote_admin_platform.html))
This example shows how to use the platform to send remote commands to a running
instance of Routing Service.

## Example Description

This example implements a one-shot application that can be used to send one remote
command to a running Routing Service instance. The application will
prepare a command request based on the command-line parameters provided in the
application invocation. After sending that request out to the service, it will
wait for a command reply to be sent by the service. The application will then exit.

### Routing Service configuration

Here you can find the Routing Service configuration files.

-   `routing_remote_admin.xml`: This is a configuration file for Routing
    Service that enables remote administration, and uses the QoS profiles
    defined in the XML QoS profiles file (`USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml`). By using
    the same QoS profiles in both the application and the *Routing Service* we
    ensure the QoS matching and the reliability of the communication.
-   `domain_route_creation.xml`: This xml has the configuration about how to
    create a new domain route that routes from domain 1 to domain 3. It is used
    by the Requester application to CREATE the new route.

## Running some examples

We describe here some examples of how to use the Remote Administration
Platform.

First of all, you have to build the Requester application. So, please follow
this [guide](c++11/README.md).

After building the Requester application, we will open two Shapes Demo:

- One has to run in domain 1 and publish `Squares`.
- The other has to run in domain 2 and subscribe `Circles`.

After that, we have to run Routing Service so the second Shapes Demo starts
receiving `Circles`:

``` bash
 rtiroutingservice -cfgFile routing_remote_admin.xml -cfgName remote_admin
```

### Deleting a Domain Route

To delete a Domain Route, just execute the Requester application located in the
build directory using the following command:

``` bash
./Requester DELETE /routing_services/remote_admin/domain_routes/MyRoute
```

### Creating a Domain Route

We will use the `domain_route_creation.xml` file to describe the new
Domain Route. Just execute the Requester application located in the
build directory using the following command:

``` bash
./Requester CREATE /routing_services/remote_admin file://domain_route_creation.xml
```

Please, note that the file has to be present in the same location where Routing
Service is being executed. Routing Service will try to read the file from there.

Run another instance of Shapes Demo that runs on Domain 3 and subscribes to `Triangles`.
You will see how `Squares` are now being route as `Triangles` from
Domain 1 to 3.

### Getting the Domain Route information

If you want to see the configuration of a specific Domain Route, just execute
the Requester application located in the build directory using the following
command:

``` bash
./Requester GET /routing_services/remote_admin/domain_routes/MyRoute
```
