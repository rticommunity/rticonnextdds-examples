# RTI Routing Service

RTI Routing Service is an out-of-the-box solution that allows developers to
rapidly scale and integrate real-time systems that are disparate or
geographically dispersed. Routing Service can be used to bridge DDS
applications across different domains to support a systems-of-systems
architecture, interoperate new and legacy applications to support new product
deployment while maintaining previous generation products or to integrate
independently-developed systems for progressive system upgrades.

The Routing Service Adapter SDK allows you to build gateways for integrating
Connext DDS with other connectivity technologies. The Adapter SDK enables you
to bridge multiple networks and topologies, and to form more complex
topologies, as needed; truly realizing the vision of Industrial Internet of
Things.

In this directory you will find some examples illustrating the most important
features of RTI Routing Service, including support for custom Adapters and
Processors. For more information, please refer to the [RTI Routing Service
