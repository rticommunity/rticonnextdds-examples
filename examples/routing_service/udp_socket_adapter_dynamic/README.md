# Example Code: Routing Service C++11 Socket Adapter using Dynamic Data

## Example Description

This example shows how to implement a simple Routing Service Adapter plugin
in C++11 to receive data from a UDP socket using RTI Routing Service.

This examples uses dynamic data API and there is no need to know the data type
information beforehand.

The code in this directory provides the following components:

-   `src/SocketAdapter` implements the plugin that is loaded by *RTI Routing
Service*. It responsible for creating and deleting connections.
-   `src/SocketConnection` implements a connection. This component is
responsible for the creation and deletion of `StreamReaders`.
-   `src/SocketInputDiscoveryStreamReader` implements the logic necessary to
propagate information about the discovered input streams (in this case
sockets) to the Routing Service.
-   `src/SocketStreamReader` implements a `StreamReader` that reads sample
information from a UDP socket.
-   `src/SocketStreamWriter` implements a `StreamWriter` that sends sample
information to a UDP socket.


For more details, please refer to the *RTI Routing Service SDK* documentation.

## Building the C++ example

In order to build this example, you need to define the variables
`CONNEXTDDS_DIR` and `CONNEXTDDS_ARCH`. You can do so by exporting them
manually, by sourcing the `rtisetenv` script for your architecture, or by
passing them to the `cmake` command as arguments:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCONNEXTDDS_DIR=<Connext DDS Directory> \     # If not exported
      -DCONNEXTDDS_ARCH=<Connext DDS Architecture> \ # If not exported
      -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON|OFF \                   # ON is preferred
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release ..
cmake --build .
cd ..
```

Example command for Windows:

```bash
cmake .. -DCONNEXTDDS_DIR="%NDDSHOME%" -DCONNEXTDDS_ARCH=x64Win64VS2015 -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -A x64 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
cd ..
```

**Note**: You do not need to define `CONNEXTDDS_ARCH` if you only have one
architecture target installed in your system.

**Note**: When compiling on a Windows 64-bit machine you will need to add the
`-A x64` parameter to the call to CMake.

**Note:** If you are using a multi-configuration generator, such as Visual
Studio Solutions, you can specify the configuration mode to build as follows:

```bash
cmake --build . --config Release|Debug
```

Here is more information about generating
[Visual Studio Solutions for Windows using CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/generator/Visual%20Studio%2016%202019.html#platform-selection).

**Note:** `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` allows you to control if the generated library
for this example is a static or a dynamic shared library. The following
sections assume you are building a dynamic shared library. However, Routing
Service also supports static linking of adapters. To use this functionality
you would need to create an application that uses Routing Service as a library
component and statically links to this `SocketAdapter` library.

### Cross-compilation

When you need to cross-compile the example, the above
command will not work, the assigned compiler won't be the cross-compiler and
errors may happen when linking against the cross-compiled Connext binaries.
To fix this, you have to create a file with the architecture name and call
CMake with a specific flag called ``-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE``.
An example of the file to create with the toolchain settings (e.g. for an
ARM architectures):

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(toolchain_path "<path to>/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian")
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "${toolchain_path}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "${toolchain_path}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++")
```

Then you can call CMake like this:

```bash
cmake -DCONNEXTDDS_DIR=<connext dir> -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<toolchain file created above>
      -DCONNEXTDDS_ARCH=<connext architecture> ..
```

## Running the C++ example

To run the example, you just need to run the following commands from the top
level folder. This example has been written to allow easy experimentation with
the RTI DDSPing tool shipped with *RTI Connext DDS* installer bundle. If you wish 
to create a real Routing Service adapter, you should modify the code and XML accordingly.

There are 2 configurations (`-cfgName`) in the Routing Service XML file:

-   **SocketAdapterToDDS** - It reads data from a UDP socket using the
SocketAdapter and outputs it to DDS. You can visualize the ouptut by running:

-   **DDSToSocketAdapter** - It sends data from DDS to a UDP socket. You can 
publish DDS data by running command:


To run Routing Service, you will need first to set up your environment as
follows.

Before running the RTI Routing Service, you need to specify where the
`SocketAdapterCpp` library is located as shown below:

Linux:

```bash
$export RTI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NDDSHOME/lib/<Connext DDS Architecture>:<Path to SocketAdapterCpp library, the build/ folder>
```

Windows:

```bash
set PATH=%NDDSHOME%/lib/<Connext DDS Architecture>;<Path to SocketAdapterCpp library, the build/Release folder>
```

The SocketAdapterCpp library will be in the `./build` folder.

```bash
# From the build/ directory
$NDDSHOME/bin/rtiroutingservice -cfgFile RsSocketAdapter.xml -cfgName SocketAdapterToDDS
```

Here is an output from a sample run:

```bash
$export RTI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/$NDDSHOME/lib/$CONNEXT_ARCH:~/udp_socket_adapter_dynamic/build/

$ $NDDSHOME/bin/rtiroutingservice -cfgFile RsSocketAdapter.xml -cfgName SocketAdapterToDDS
RTI Routing Service 7.3.0 executing (with name SocketAdapterToSocketAdapter)
```

Now you'll need to send data to the UDP sockets. By default, DDS Ping data is
expected on `127.0.0.1:10203`. You can change both the expected type and topic name 
and the UDP socket configuration on `RsSocketAdapter.xml`.

To run a simple test, run in different terminals:

```bash
$export RTI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/$NDDSHOME/lib/$CONNEXT_ARCH:~/udp_socket_adapter_dynamic/build/

$ $NDDSHOME/bin/rtiroutingservice -cfgFile RsSocketAdapter.xml -cfgName DDSToSocketAdapter
RTI Routing Service 7.3.0 executing (with configuration=DDSToSocketAdapter)
```


```bash
 $NDDSHOME/bin/rtiddsping -publisher -domainId 0
```

## Running a data-diode example

You can configure a data-diode scenario by using two Routing Services instances;
- One using **DDSToSocketAdapter** configuration to publish DDS data over a one direction UDP socket
- The other using **SocketAdapterToDDS** configuration to convert back to DDS samples
```                                                                                        
  ┌───────────┐  ┌─────────────┐                         ┌─────────────┐  ┌───────────┐ 
  │  Connext  │  │   Routing   │    ┌────────────────┐   │   Routing   │  │  Connext  │ 
  │    App    ├─►│   Service   ├───►│ UDP DATA DIODE ├──►│   Service   ├─►│    App    │ 
  │           │  │ DDS TO UDP  │    └────────────────┘   │ UDP TO DDS  │  │           │ 
  └───────────┘  └─────────────┘                         └─────────────┘  └───────────┘ 
```                                                                                        
To run this example in a local machine:
```bash
$export RTI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/$NDDSHOME/lib/$CONNEXT_ARCH:~/udp_socket_adapter_dynamic/build/

$ $NDDSHOME/bin/rtiroutingservice -cfgFile RsSocketAdapter.xml -cfgName SocketAdapterToDDS
RTI Routing Service 7.3.0 executing (with configuration=SocketAdapterToDDS)
```
And in a different terminal:
```bash
$export RTI_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/$NDDSHOME/lib/$CONNEXT_ARCH:~/udp_socket_adapter_dynamic/build/

$ $NDDSHOME/bin/rtiroutingservice -cfgFile RsSocketAdapter.xml -cfgName DDSToSocketAdapter
RTI Routing Service 7.3.0 executing (with configuration=DDSToSocketAdapter)
```

Using the default configuration from RsSocketAdapter.xml, you need to publish DDS Ping data 
on domain id 0 and subscribe to DSS Ping data on domain id 1:

```bash
 $NDDSHOME/bin/rtiddsping -publisher -domainId 0
```

```bash
 $NDDSHOME/bin/rtiddsping -subscriber -domainId 1
```

## Requirements

To run this example you will need:

- RTI Connext Professional version 6.0.0 or higher.
- CMake version 3.10 or higher.
- A target platform with support for RTI Routing Service and C++11.
- Python3.
