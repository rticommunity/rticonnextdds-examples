# Example Code: Routing Service Processor

## Concept

*Routing Service Processor* is a pluggable-component that allows controlling the
forwarding process that occurs within *Routes*. Refer to the [SDK
documentation](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/current/doc/api/routing_service/api_cpp/group__RTI__RoutingServiceProcessorModule.html)
to learn more about how to implement and use custom *Processor* plug-ins.

## Example Description

This example shows how to implement a custom *Processor* plug-in, build it into
a shared library and load it with *RoutingService*.

This example illustrates the realization of two common enterprise patterns:
aggregation and splitting. There is a single plug-in implementation,
*ShapesProcessor* that is factory of three types of *Processor*\s:

-   *ShapesAggregatorSimple* and *ShapesAggregatorAdv*: *Processor*
    implementations that performs the aggregation of two *ShapeType* objects
    into a single *ShapeType* object.

-   *ShapesSplitter*: *Processor* implementation that performs the separation of
    a single *ShapeType* object into two  *ShapeType* objects.

In the example, these processors are instantiated as part of a *TopicRoute*, in
which all its inputs and outputs represent instantiations of the *Connext DDS
Adapter StreamReader* and *StreamWriter*, respectively.

In this example you will find files for the following elements:

-   `ShapesProcessor`: the custom *Processor* plug-in, generated as a shared
    library, that contains the implementation for both aggregation and split
    processors.

-   Configuration for the *RoutingService* that loads the custom *Processor* and
    provides the communication between publisher and subscriber applications.

This *Processor* implementation can receive the following properties:

-   `shapes_processor.kind` (`<enum>`):
    -   *aggregator_simple*: Indicates the plug-in to instantiate a
        ShapesAggregatoSimpler.
    -   *aggregator_adv*: Indicates the plug-in to instantiate a
        ShapesAggregatorAdv.
    -   *splittler*: Indicates the plug-in to instantiate a ShapesSplitter.
        If a different value other than the ones above is specified, the
        creation of the will throw an exception. If this property is not
        specified, it will create a *ShapesSplitter*.
-   `shapes_processor.leading_input_index` (`<integer>`):
    -   Only applicable to *ShapesAggregatorAdv*. Indicates the index of the
        leading input. In this example, only 0 and 1 are valid values.

### ShapesAggregator

There are two implementations of aggregation intended to show different
approaches to access and manipulate data.

#### ShapesAggregatorSimple

This implementation shows very basic usage of the capabilities *Processor* where
inputs and outputs are accessed by their configuration names (which also match
the *Topic* names, and the aggregation pattern is very simple: it produces
`Triangle` samples whose position is obtained from `Square` samples, and the
size is obtained from the `y` coordinate obtained from `Circle` samples.

The aggregation logic relies on the reception samples from the `Square`input to
trigger data forwarding, and merge available data from the `Circle` input. Note
that for the purpose of this example, the names of the inputs and outputs are
hardcoded into the plug-in implementation. A recommended approach is to make
this value as arguments to the *Processor* creation, or use an algorithm
independent of these values, as shown in *ShapesAggregatorAdv*.

#### ShapesAggregatorAdv

The data processing is tied to a *leading input*, that represents the input from
which the processor reads *new* data first. For each instance found in the data
read from the leading input, the processor reads *any* existing data for the
equivalent instance.

The aggregation algorithm consists of simply an average of the values `x` and
`y` of all inputs. The remaining elements are set equal to the values of the
data read from the leading input.

>**Note**:
>
> For the proper behavior of both *Processor*\s it's required for the DDS inputs
> to be configured with a history policy that preserves only the last sample.
> This guarantees that memory doesn't grow unbounded since the processor will
> never remove the samples from the StreamReader's cache.

### ShapesSplitter

The splitting algorithm consists of assigning:

- Input value `x` to the first output, leaving `y` with value zero.
- Input value `y` to the second output, leaving `x` with value zero.
- Remaining values are set equally from the input values.

This *Processor* implementation does not receive any configuration properties.

## Requirements

To run this example you will need:

- RTI Connext Professional version 6.0.0 or higher.
- CMake version 3.7 or higher
- A target platform supported by *RTI* *RoutingService*.
