Dynamic Data API, access to complex member example
===============================================================

Concept
-------

Dynamic data API allows to create topic samples in a programmatically manner 
without defining an IDL in compile time. Analogously to the IDL based approach, 
the DynamicData API provide methods to get/set complex members in dynamic data 
samples. 

In this example, we show how to access structs nested in a dynamic data object 
to get/set their values.

 
Example description
-------------------
In this example, we use the two Dynamic Data APIs provided by RTI Connext to 
access to sample members that are not one of the primitive types. 

The first API the get/set API, copies the value of a Dynamic Data complex 
member into a new Dynamic Data object. As a consequence, any modification on the
newly created object will not affect the original member. 

The second API, the bind/unbind API, allows to reference of a complex member 
sing a new Dynamic Data object. This binding is a reference to the original 
nested member, so any modification on this object will affect the original 
member.

The datatypes used for our examples are the following ones:

struct InnerStruct {
   double x;
   double y;
}; 

struct OuterStruct {
   InnerStruct inner;
};
