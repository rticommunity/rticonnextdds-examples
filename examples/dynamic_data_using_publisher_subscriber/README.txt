=======================================================
 Dynamic Data API, publish/subscribe with Dynamic Data
=======================================================

Concept
-------

This example shows how to publish and subscribe Shapes using the Dynamic Data 
API. There are two approaches, use generated data if we have the IDL or create
the type from scratch.

If we have the IDL, as in the case of the Shapes.idl provided with ShapesDemo, 
we can re-use the type code generated by rtiddsgen (found in Shapes.c). This 
way, we can use our generated type with tools that needs DynamicData as an 
input such as Routing Service plugins). This is the approach we will follow in 
this example.

If you do not have the IDL or needs to create the type dynamically, you can 
follow other examples in the Community to create your type code and then 
integrate it with this example.


Example Description
-------------------
Based on the generated code from Shapes.idl, we create a Dynamic Data publisher 
and subscribers for a Square.

This example is ready to be integrated with ShapesDemo as explained in the 
README file of each specific language.

The Shapes.idl contains the following data structure:

struct ShapeType {
 string<128> color; //@key
 long x;
 long y;
 long shapesize;
};
