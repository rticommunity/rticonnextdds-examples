# Example Code: Use the get_publishers() API

## Concept
The *get_publishers()* API allow the application to access all the publishers
the participant has.

## Example Description
In this example we illustrate how to call the *get_publishers()* API on a
participant and how to iterate on the returned sequence and enumerate all the
publishers.

First, we create two publishers. Then, we call the *get_publishers()* API.
Finally we iterate on the returned sequence to print a reference to the publishers
