# Example Code: Whitelist

## Concept

This example showcases how to use the whitelisting feature added in Connext
Secure 7.2.0. A participant's whitelist allows you to control which other
participants it will communicate with based on their identities. This example is
based on a standard rtiddsgen publisher and subscriber example code. The
publisher's whitelist will change periodically, based on which the subscribers
receiving data will change.
