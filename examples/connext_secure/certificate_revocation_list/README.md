# Example Code: Using a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)

## Concept

This example showcases how to use a certificate revocation list (CRL) to revoke a Connext participant in Connext Secure 7.2.0. The example will begin with a publisher and a subscriber communicating securely. You will then be able to revoke the identity certificate of the subscriber, and communication will end as Connext identifies the updated CRL.

This example also shows certificate renewal, and how you can renew your participant's certificates without having to restart them.
