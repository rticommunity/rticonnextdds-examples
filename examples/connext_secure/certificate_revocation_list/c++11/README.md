# Example Code: Using a Certificate Revocation List

## Building the Example

Remember to set your environment variables with the script in your Connext
installation directory before building.

```sh
cd c++11/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Note: The build process also copies USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml into the build
directory to ensure that it is loaded when you run the examples within the build
directory.

## Setting up Security artifacts

The build process copies the security folder with .cnf files into the build
directory. Use the provided python script to initialize them. This means that
`build/security` will contain all the security artifacts needed to run this example.

```sh
cd security
python3 setup_security.py
```

Initializing an empty CRL

```sh
cd ca
python3 create_empty_crl.py
```

## Running the example

Demo is based on a standard rtiddsgen publisher and subscriber example code.
Revoking of the certificate is done via the script in the ca folder:

Run a publisher and a subscriber in separate terminal windows.

```sh
./Crl_publisher
```

```sh
./Crl_subscriber
```

Verify that they communicate and that the subscriber is receiving data.

Run the revoke.py script from the `build/security/ca` directory in a separate
terminal window, and communication between the participants will stop.

```sh
cd security/ca
python3 revoke.py
```

You will see the following on the subscriber:

```sh
[value: 53]
::ShapeType subscriber sleeping up to 1 sec...
::ShapeType subscriber sleeping up to 1 sec...
[value: 54]
::ShapeType subscriber sleeping up to 1 sec...

It will no longer receive data. The publisher will also print a log message:

## Simulating Certificate Renewal

To restart communication, call the script again to give the participants new
certificates. You can do this without restarting the applications.

First, delete the contents of `build/security/ca/database/CaIndex`.
Alternatively, you can delete the file and create a new empty one.
Then, run the following to give the participants new certificates.

```sh
cd build/security
python3 setup_security.py
cd ca
python3 create_empty_crl.py
```

They will start communicating again, because of the
`com.rti.serv.secure.files_poll_interval` property.
This allows you to renew your certificates without having to restart
your applications.
