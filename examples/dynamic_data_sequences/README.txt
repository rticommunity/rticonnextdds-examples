Accessing to sequence members on Dynamic Data
==============================================


Concept
=======
Dynamic Data provides an easy way to access the members of a data sample. Such members can be 
primitive data types or complex data types such as arrays or sequences.

While the access to certain members is done using a name, the access in multiple cardinality 
data types (such as arrays or sequences) are done using a index based access.

Primitive type sequences such as DDS_Long and DDS_Double sequences can be usually accessed
using dedicated methods such as get_<type>_array() and get_<type>_seq(). However, such approach
is not possible for non-primitive data (such as user defined types).

Dynamic data allows accessing to the elements of arrays and sequences using a 1-based index access. 
For this purpuse the use of methods such get_complex_member() or bind_complex_member() are required. 

Example description
===================

This example shows how to access to elements in array/sequence based dynamic data types.

For this example we define the following types:


struct SimpleStruct {
 			long a_member;
};

struct TypeWithSequence {
	sequence<MAX_LEN,SimpleStruct> sequence_member;
};

In this example first we fill the 'sequence_member' sequence with data (write_data function). After that, we access
to each of the elements in the sequence (read_data function).

The same concepts shown in this example works for arrays and primitive sequences.
