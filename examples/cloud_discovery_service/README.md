# Cloud Discovery Service

Cloud Discovery Service is a stand-alone application that deploys Connext
applications in dynamic environments where UDP/IP multicast is not available.
This is typical of wide-area networks or some cloud-based environments where
the routers and switches may disable IP multicast forwarding. For WAN
deployments where applications require Network Address Translator (NAT)
traversal, Cloud Discovery Service can aid on this process in combination
with RTI Real-Time WAN Transport, which is part of Connext Professional.

In this directory you will find some examples that illustrate the use of RTI
Cloud Discovery Service. For more information about RTI Cloud Discovery Service,
please refer to the [RTI Cloud Discovery Service User's
Manual](https://community.rti.com/static/documentation/connext-dds/7.0.0/doc/manuals/addon_products/cloud_discovery_service/index.html).
