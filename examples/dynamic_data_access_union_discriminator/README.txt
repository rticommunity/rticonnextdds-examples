============================================================
 Example Code -- Access Union Discriminators in Dynamic Data
============================================================

Concept
-------
Unions in IDL are mapped to structs in C and C++, so that Connext will not 
have to dynamically allocate memory for unions containing variable-length 
fields such as strings or sequences. To be efficient, the entire struct 
(or class in C++/CLI) is not sent when the union is published. Instead, 
Connext uses the discriminator field of the struct to decide what field 
in the struct is actually sent on the wire.

Example Description
--------------------
In this example we illustrate how to access the discriminator of a Union 
using the Dynamic Data API.

First, we create the TypeCode for the Union. Then, we create a Dynamic Data 
instance of it and finally, we show how to access the discriminator.
