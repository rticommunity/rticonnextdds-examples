Description
XML QoS Profile for waitsets_query_cond

The QoS configuration of the DDS entities in the generated example is loaded 
from this file.

This file is used only when it is in the current working directory or when the
environment variable NDDS_QOS_PROFILES is defined and points to this file.

The profile in this file inherits from the builtin QoS profile 
BuiltinQosLib::Generic.StrictReliable. That profile, along with all of the 
other built-in QoS profiles can be found in the 
BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml file located in the 
$NDDSHOME/resource/qos_profiles_5.2.0/xml/ directory.

You may use any of these QoS configurations in your application simply by 
referring to them by the name shown in the 
BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml file and listed below: 

* In library "BuiltinQosLib":
** Baseline
** Baseline.5.0.0
** Baseline.5.1.0
** Generic.Common
** Generic.Monitoring.Common
** Generic.ConnextMicroCompatibility
** Generic.OtherDDSVendorCompatibility

* In library "BuiltinQosLibExp":
** Generic.StrictReliable
** Generic.KeepLastReliable
** Generic.BestEffort
** Generic.StrictReliable.HighThroughput
** Generic.StrictReliable.LowLatency
** Generic.Participant.LargeData
** Generic.Participant.LargeData.Monitoring
** Generic.StrictReliable.LargeData
** Generic.KeepLastReliable.LargeData
** Generic.StrictReliable.LargeData.FastFlow
** Generic.StrictReliable.LargeData.MediumFlow
** Generic.StrictReliable.LargeData.SlowFlow
** Generic.KeepLastReliable.LargeData.FastFlow
** Generic.KeepLastReliable.LargeData.MediumFlow
** Generic.KeepLastReliable.LargeData.SlowFlow
** Generic.KeepLastReliable.TransientLocal
** Generic.KeepLastReliable.Transient
** Generic.KeepLastReliable.Persistent
** Generic.AutoTuning
** Pattern.PeriodicData
** Pattern.Streaming
** Pattern.ReliableStreaming
** Pattern.Event
** Pattern.AlarmEvent
** Pattern.Status
** Pattern.AlarmStatus
** Pattern.LastValueCache

You should not edit the file BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml directly.
However, if you wish to modify any of the values in a built-in profile, the
recommendation is to create a profile of your own and inherit from the built-in
profile you wish to modify. The NDDS_QOS_PROFILES.example.xml file (contained in 
the same directory as the BuiltinProfiles.documentationONLY.xml file) shows how
to inherit from the built-in profiles. 

For more information about XML QoS Profiles see Chapter 15 in the 
RTI Connext user manual.
