Example code: Using Property QoS
=============================================

Building C# Example
===================
Before compiling or running the example, make sure the environment variable
NDDSHOME is set to the directory where your version of RTI Connext is installed.

Run rtiddsgen with the -example option and the target architecture of your 
choice (e.g., i86Win32dotnet4.0). The RTI Connext Core Libraries and Utilities 
Getting Started Guide describes this process in detail. Follow the same 
procedure to generate the code and build the examples. Do not use the -replace
option.

On Windows systems (assuming you want to generate an example for i86Win32VSdotnet4.0) run:
rtiddsgen -language C# -example i86Win32dotnet4.0 numbers.idl

File C:\local\property_qos\cs\numbers_subscriber.cs already 
exists and will not be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a 
new file with the new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.
File C:\local\property_qos\cs\numbers_publisher.cs already 
exists and will not be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a 
new file with the new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.

This is normal and is only informing you that the subscriber/publisher code has
not been replaced, which is fine since all the source files for the example are
already provided.

Running C# Example
==================
In two separate command prompt windows for the publisher and subscriber. Run
the following commands from the example directory (this is necessary to ensure 
the application loads the QoS defined in USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml):
On Windows systems run:
bin\<build_type>-VS2010\numbers_publisher.exe  <domain_id> <samples_to_send>
bin\<build_type>-VS2010\numbers_subscriber.exe <domain_id> <sleep_periods>

The applications accept two arguments:
1. The <domain_id>. Both applications must use the same domain id in order to 
communicate. The default is 0.
2. How long the examples should run -- measured in samples for the publisher 
and sleep periods for the subscriber. A value of '0' instructs the 
application to run forever; this is the default.
