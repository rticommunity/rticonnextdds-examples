 Example Code -- Partitions
===========================================

Concept
-------
The PARTITION QoS provides another way to control which DataWriters will 
match -- and thus communicate with -- which DataReaders. It can be used to 
prevent DataWriters and DataReaders that would have otherwise matched with 
the same Topic and compatible QosPolicies from talking to each other. Much 
in the same way that only applications within the same domain will communicate 
with each other, only DataWriters and DataReaders that belong to the same
partition can talk to each other.

The PARTITION QoS consists of a set of partition names that identify the 
partitions of which the Entity is a member. These names are simply strings, 
and DataWriters and DataReaders are considered to be in the same partition 
if they have more than one partition name in common in the PARTITION 
QoS set on their Publishers or Subscribers.

Example description
----------------
In the Publisher application, we change the Partition name list every 5
samples. Our purpose is to show how literals and regular expressions 
can be used to match the subscriber's name list. 

In the subscriber application, we create a reliable reader, and request
old samples upon joining, showing  that partitions are subscriber-based, 
not data-based. If we start the subscriber late,  it will receive all samples 
available, even those that were published while under incompatible partitions.

Furthermore, if the reader and writer unpair due to a partition mismatch, the
reader will interpret the instance as new if it reconnects.
