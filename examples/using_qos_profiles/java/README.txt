 Example Code -- Using_Qos_profiles
===========================================

Building Java Example
=====================
Before compiling or running the example, make sure the environment variable 
NDDSHOME is set to the directory where your version of RTI Connext is installed.

Run rtiddsgen with the -example option and the target architecture of your 
choice (e.g., i86Win32jdk or i86Linux2.6gcc4.4.3jdk). The RTI Connext Core 
Libraries and Utilities Getting Started Guide describes this process in detail. 
Follow the same procedure to generate the code and build the examples. Do not 
use the -replace option.

On Windows systems run:

rtiddsgen -language Java -example i86Win32jdk profiles.idl

On UNIX systems (assuming you want to generate an example for 
i86Linux2.6gcc4.4.3) run:

rtiddsgen -language Java -example i86Linux2.6gcc4.4.3jdk profiles.idl

You will see messages that look like this:

File C:\local\profiles\java\profilesSubscriber.java already exists and 
will not be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file 
with the new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.
File C:\local\profiles\java\profilesPublisher.java already exists and 
will not be replaced with updated content. If you would like to get a new file 
with the new content, either remove this file or supply -replace option.

This is normal and is only informing you that the subscriber/publisher code has 
not been replaced, which is fine since all the source files for the example are 
already provided.

Before compiling in Java, make sure that the desired version of the javac 
compiler is in your PATH environment variable.

On Windows systems run:

javac -classpath .;%NDDSHOME%\class\nddsjava.jar profiles.java profilesSeq.java
 profilesTypeSupport.java profilesTypeCode.java profilesDataReader.java 
 profilesDataWriter.java profilesSubscriber.java profilesPublisher.java

On Unix systems (including Linux and MacOS X):

javac -classpath .:$NDDSHOME/class/nddsjava.jar profiles.java profilesSeq.java
 profilesTypeSupport.java profilesTypeCode.java profilesDataReader.java 
 profilesDataWriter.java profilesSubscriber.java waitsetsPublisher.java

After building the example, put USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml and 
my_custom_qos_profiles.xml in the directory you will run your application from.


Running Java Example
====================
Before running, make sure that the native Java libraries on which RTI Connext
depends are in your environment path (or library path). To add Java libraries 
to your environment...

On Windows systems run: 
set PATH=%NDDSHOME%\lib\i86Win32jdk;%PATH%

On Unix systems except MacOS X (assuming you are using Bash) run:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NDDSHOME/lib/<platform_name>jdk:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

On MacOSX (assuming your are using Bash) run:
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$NDDSHOME/lib/<platform_name>jdk:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

Then, in two separate command prompt windows for the publisher and subscriber. 
Run the following commands from the example directory (this is necessary to 
ensure the application loads the QoS defined in USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml):

On Windows systems run:

java -cp .;%NDDSHOME%\class\nddsjava.jar profilesPublisher  <domain_id> 
    <samples_to_send>
java -cp .;%NDDSHOME%\class\nddsjava.jar profilesSubscriber <domain_id> 
    <sleep_periods>

On Unix systems (including Linux and MacOS X) run:

java -cp .:$NDDSHOME/class/nddsjava.jar profilesPublisher  <domain_id> 
    <samples_to_send>
java -cp .:$NDDSHOME/class/nddsjava.jar profilesSubscriber <domain_id> 
    <sleep_periods>


The applications accept two arguments:

   1. The <domain_id>. Both applications must use the same domain ID in order to 
   communicate. The default is 0.
   2. How long the examples should run, measured in samples. A value of '0' 
   instructs the application to run forever; this is the default.


Publisher Output
================

Writing profiles, count 0
Writing profile_name = volatile_profile x = 0
Writing profile_name = transient_local_profile x = 0
Writing profiles, count 1
Writing profile_name = volatile_profile x = 1
Writing profile_name = transient_local_profile x = 1
Writing profiles, count 2
Writing profile_name = volatile_profile x = 2
Writing profile_name = transient_local_profile x = 2
Writing profiles, count 3
Writing profile_name = volatile_profile x = 3
Writing profile_name = transient_local_profile x = 3

Subscriber Output
=================
Notice that the volatile DataReader receives both transient local and volatile 
data, because the QoS is request/offered, and volatile QoS matches with the 
higher transient local level of service.
